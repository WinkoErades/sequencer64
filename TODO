Note lengths recorded are fixed to grid when in MIDI sync instead of lenght
played #179:

   I am using Alsa for MIDI. When I record with seq64 as clock master, the
   note lenghts are recorded as played. But when I switch to seq64 being the
   clock slave, the note length that is played is ignored, and the note
   length is fixed to the grid quantisation (not note lenght) setting.
   The keyboard used for recording is a separate midi device and is not the
   clock master when seq64 is the clock slave.
   I changed no settings in seq64 when going from clock slave to master and
   vice versa.

   Also, when going back from clock slave to master again, there seems to be
   a lot of notes in the MIDI buffer that get played rapidly until the buffer
   is empty. I have to start/stop several times to get a clean start.

   Part 2:

   I started Seq64 without launching Jack on Lubuntu (I did not start the
   Jack UI and server, but I can check if this is maybe launched in the
   background), with the -p --alsa options.
   I switched from Jack to Alsa because the seq64 clock in external sync has
   way less jitter using Alsa.
   In internal clocking also Alsa is quite jittery (this is a separate
   topic).
   I compiled the newest sources using the Gtkmm interface with all the
   standard settings, no changes were made after the git clone. The Midi
   channel recorded is on a seperate Midi input port using a midi-keyboard. I
   can send a screensot of the settings later on, as this is on a separate
   PC. Basically all the Jack flags in the settings are switched off (--alsa
   command line option).
   Also with these settings I can start seq24 up as a sync master with the
   play button.
   I am in "Live" mode and set the "fruity" interaction method.
   I hope this helps! Thank you for looking into this issue!

   Part 3:

   I am starting the sequencer like this:

   `seq64 -p --alsa --verbose --no-jack-midi
   Forcing all-ALSA mode.
   [Deactivating JACK MIDI]

   37 rtmidi ports created:
   Input ports (19):
   [0] 0:1 system:announce (system)
   [1] 14:0 Midi Through:Midi Through Port-0
   [2] 20:0 USB Device 0x86a:0x01:USB Device 0x86a:0x01 MIDI 1
   ...
   Output ports (18):
   [0] 14:0 Midi Through:Midi Through Port-0
   [1] 20:0 USB Device 0x86a:0x01:USB Device 0x86a:0x01 MIDI 1
   ...

   When I record synced to external Midi clock and record notes, they are all
   recorded with the snap to grid value for the length, no matter how long I
   hold the notes (I played some random stuff just for illustration):
   [2]grafik

   Apart from this issue, the timing in this sync mode is very good.

   If I do not sync externally but just hit play in seq64, the notes are
   recorded correctly, but unfortunately the clock and playback of seq64 is a
   lot more jittery.

   Note:  make_clock() is unused!!!!!

Sequencer64 0.96.5 on Windows Issues:

    #1
    On the pattern editor, "Incoming Midi goes through to output" does not
    work; this works as expected if I use older build "0.95.4 Master"
    #2
    Edit -> Preferences
    Midi Clock tab is initially visible, but is never accessible again after
    user clicks onto another tab (program must be restarted to access this
    Note this tab was never available in build "0.95.4 Master"

    Q: what is the difference between On (Pos) and On (Mod)?
    FYI: I am using a virtual midi port (which is set to OFF in "Midi Clock"
    tab); neither ON option affects issue #1...

    Hello and thanks for Sequencer64!
    Getting my feet wet with v 0.95 on Windows7 x64- is it expected that
    some keyboard shortcuts under Windows don t work?
    There is no mention of this in section 12.2 of manual; also my usr and
    rc files are unmodified and contain the defaults.
    Here are two examples of the many I have come across, making following
    along with the manual difficult...

Thanks for all again, ill leave here my 12 * 8 (looks really like ableton now
lol!, the only thing its one has to turn off the previous pattern
group, so i have to press 2 button on my nanopad, its boring a little
but i can deal with it!) midi sequencer64.rc conf file with a0 b0 c1

i mean if i change pattern group by pressing note buttons, i have to turn off
the previous one (the playing one) and turn on the next (next pattern group)
at the same time.

A0 B0 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 are piano keyboard notes+octave (lecter = note;
number=octave) corresponding to my nanopad buttons.

Make fruity more fruity #169:

zwerverinteractive commented 10 days ago

to make the roll more fruity: left-click, hold and horizontal movement should
not draw more notes, this is brush behavior not pencil. odds are you don't
click exactly right immediately.  holding control while dragging temp-disables
snap.  right-click hold on empty space draws selection-box, should start
erasing notes middle-click,hold and move should scroll roll not resize
selected notes can't resize notes after drawing a couple of them and leave
them unedited (separate issue?)

    would love these fixed :D

Debian (and other) Packaging:

    -   Still need to get a static package to work.
    -   Refresh the verbatim examples for the "rc" and "usr" files
        in the sequencer64-doc project.

Colors:

    -   Copy/paste does not transfer the colors.  Should it?

Build Issues:

    -   In the Makefiles, "-I..", "-I../include", and "-I../../include" appear
        more than once on command lines.

Tempo Track:

    -   Separate tempo for each pattern (a feature request)?  This might be
        equivalent to supporting the rarely-implemented SMF 2.
    -   Provide a key or press to insert a tempo event at current mouse
        position in time and tempo-height?
    -   The sequence draw marker still can get messed up by seqedit, and
        mess up the drawing of the tempo track in perfroll.
    -   The PrCh and Tempo messages group keep swapping locations with the
        TimeSig message.  Weird!  Sad!

            midi_container::fill()
                m_events.sort()

Modify flag:

    -   sequence::set_transposable() is called when loading a sequence at
        startup.  If the flag value is different from the current value
        (false?) then sequence::modify() is called, but the perform m_parent
        is null, so it does not take effect, which is good in this case
        (startup).  At that time, we have m_transposable == true, flag = false
        (!), and the sequence number is (-1).
    -   If the velocity of notes is edited in the data panel of seqedit,
        the modification is not detected.
    -   If the main tempo control is modified, the modification is not
        detected.

Random bugs:

    -   JACK MIDI does not auto connect with the JACK connect button is
        clicked.
    -   Clicking the Stop button toggles (!) playback if Space is configured
        to both start and stop playback!!
    -   If the MIDI file has no performance info (triggers), make the
        Song/Live button show "Live".
    -   When recording a short pattern, and holding a note across the
        pattern end, the drawing is bad.  Probably should just delete such
        notes.
    -   Pressing the keep-queue activates the Q button, but pressing another
        key, or the temporary queue key, or changing the current screen set,
        does *not* de-activate the keep-queue status.
    -   Doing "/1" to turn on queueing seems to require "1" to be struck twice.
        sequence::set_playing() turns it off.  This was due to the "/" key
        being defined as both the Slot Shift key and the Queue key.  We should
        detect duplicates!  Sad!  Also note that, in the traditional
        [keyboard-group] setup, the keys 9, 0, o, l, and p are available.
        Kepler34 devotes the "." to the one-shot feature.  Where can we put
        this, our main keyboard tab is filled!  Looks like [extended-keys] is
        the only place for "One-Shot Song Record".  For the queue key, 'o' is
        a good mnemonic choice for "queue on/off".
    -   Song-recording does not respect the snap setting on muting.
    -   Song-recording does not respect the queuing feature; the trigger
        is created as soon as queuing is turned on.

Rtmidi implementation issues to work out:

    -   Support for passing along the BPM and PPQN
        -   At startup time
        -   When changed in the GUI
    -   Make the STRIP_MUTES option permanent.

Hot ideas (from GitHub):

    -   Mute button should be inactive unless there are armed sequences.  The
        name is a bit misleading.  Maybe it should toggle them all on if none
        are armed.
    -   Any way to make playback multicore?  The "stress" file maxes out a
        core.
    -   Many more to come.  Need a real roadmap Doxygen document.

Puzzles:

    -   Tooltips are too flickery with unclutter enabled.
    -   In multi-wid indep mode, when set 1 (second set) is showing in slots 1
        and 2, clicking on pattern-slot 0 (pattern 32) in slot 1 toggles only
        the pattern in pattern slot 0, but clicking on the same pattern-slot
        is the second mainwid slot properly toggles both.  Actually, the rule
        is that only the one clicked, and the top-right one, toggle.  The
        reason this happens is that sequence::is_dirty_main() turns off the
        flag after the call, so only the current and first sets see the dirty
        status (how does the first see it, though?)
    -   The Shift Key processing of Seq64 is different from Seq24.  For
        example, implementing Mod Replace with "{" (Shift-[) in Seq24
        basically works, but in Seq64 it unmutes all other patterns!
        Using a non-shift character seems to work in both, though in Seq64 the
        repeat-key rate seems to show up as an mildly annoying jitter.
    -   Toggle JACK keys does nothing.  (What does this even mean?  Was I
        drunk when I wrote it?)

More issues:

 1. Does the Replace/Solo feature work?

    a. Hot-key.  This does not work until the "keep queue" key is pressed.
       Then, pressing the "replace" key and a pattern hot-key simultaneously
       queues all the other patterns to turn off at the end of their pattern.

    b. The Shift-click works both ways in the patterns panel, but only mutes
       (does not unmute, even though the color changes back) in the song editor!
       WRONG.  IT WORKS in both windows.

 2. Why do the two B4 files (GM vs patchless) play at different BPMs?

 3. Check logic for playback, menu-disabling, and Menu button.

 4. JACK

    a. With no JACK transport/MIDI in play, changing BPM control -->

       jack_transport_reposition called with a NULL client
       jack_transport_reposition(): bad position structure

    b. Playback without a client (such as Yoshimi) proceeds fine in ALSA, but
       not in JACK.  Turns out the reason is:

        register_port: JACK error registering port seq64 midi in 0

       So, at some point, ...

 5. Patterns panel arrow key does not snap to position, it moves a whole snap
    position.

 6. File / New needs to render the current filename inactive, otherwise
    the previous file is overwritten.

 x. Features:

   a. If in Song Mode, and all patterns end, end the playback as well.

   b. A way to place progress-bar at desired location (seq32? kepler34?).

Tests:

    -   Test the assertion that queuing also works for "groups".
    -   Test how seq24 handles screen-sets and playback; does it restrict
        playing to the current screen-set only?

Upgrades:

    -o, --options:

        We want to support app-specific options:

        seq64cli:

            -   daemonize.  Need to figure out when to daemonize, and
                to what value the current working directory should be
                set [e.g. rc().last_used_dir], or do we need another
                directory option value?
            -   file list ?

        seq64rtmidi:

            -   no GUI (daemonize)? :-D
