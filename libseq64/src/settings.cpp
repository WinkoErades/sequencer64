/**
 *  Common code for handling PPQN settings.  Putting it here means we can
 *  reduce the reliance on the global PPQN, and have a lot more flexibility in
 *  changing the PPQN.
 *
 *  However, this function works completely only if the "user" configuration
 *  file has already been read.  In some cases we may need to retrofit the
 *  desired PPQN value!  Also, the default constructor for
 *  seqmenu::sm_clipboard is called before we read either the configuration
 *  files or the MIDI file, so we don't report issues when that happens.
 *
 * \param ppqn
 *      Provides the PPQN value to be used.  The legal values are:
 *
 *      -   SEQ64_USE_FILE_PPQN (0).  Return 0.  The caller should then get
 *          the PPQN from the usr().file_ppqn() or usr().midi_ppqn() values,
 *          perhaps by calling this function again with no parameters. See the
 *          next option below.
 *      -   SEQ64_USE_DEFAULT_PPQN (-1).  This is the default value of this
 *          parameter.  Behavior:
 *          -   Return the value of usr().midi_ppqn(), if in the range
 *              SEQ64_MINIMUM_PPQN to SEQ64_MAXIMUM_PPQN.  The default
 *              PPQN value can be changed (from 192 to another value) on the
 *              command-line (options "--ppqn" or "-q"), or in the "usr"
 *              configuration file at the "midi_ppqn" setting.
 *          -   If usr().midi_ppqn() is SEQ64_USE_FILE_PPQN (0), then return
 *              usr().file_ppqn() instead.  If that is invalid, return
 *              SEQ64_DEFAULT_PPQN (192).
 *          -   If usr().midi_ppqn() is invalid, return SEQ64_DEFAULT_PPQN.
 *      -   Legal PPQN.  Return it unchanged.
 *      -   Illegal PPQN.  Return SEQ64_DEFAULT_PPQN.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns the ppqn parameter, unless that parameter is one of the
 *      special values above, or is illegal, as noted above.
