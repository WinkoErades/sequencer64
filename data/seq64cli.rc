# Written on 2020-02-09 18:19:38
#
# This file holds the main configuration options for Sequencer64.
# It follows the format of the legacy seq24 'rc' configuration
# file, but adds some new options, such as LASH, Mod4 interaction
# support, an auto-save-on-exit option, and more.  Also provided
# is a legacy mode.
#
# The [comments] section can document this file.  Lines starting
# with '#' and '[' are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.  Show a
# blank line by adding a space character to the line.

(Comments added to this section are preserved.  Lines starting with
 a '#' or '[', or that are blank, are ignored.  Start lines that must
 be blank with a space.)

[midi-control]

# The leftmost number on each line here is the pattern number, from
# 0 to 31; or it is the group number, from 32 to 63, for up to 32 
# groups; or it is an automation control number, from 64 to 95.
# This internal MIDI control number is followed by three groups of
# bracketed numbers, each providing three different type of control:
#
#    Normal:           [toggle]    [on]      [off]
#    Playback:         [pause]     [start]   [stop]
#    Playlist:         [by-value]  [next]    [previous] (if active)
#
# In each group, there are six numbers:
#
#    [on/off invert status d0 d1min d1max]
#
# 'on/off' enables/disables (1/0) the MIDI control for the pattern.
# 'invert' (1/0) causes the opposite if data is outside the range.
# 'status' is by MIDI event to match (channel is NOT ignored).
# 'd0' is the first data value.  Example: if status is 144 (Note On),
# then d0 represents Note 0.
# 'd1min'/'d1max' are the range of second values that should match.
# Example:  For a Note On for note 0, 0 and 127 indicate that any
# Note On velocity will cause the MIDI control to take effect.

[midi-clock]

# The first line indicates the number of MIDI busses defined.
# Each buss line contains the buss (re 0) and the clock status of
# that buss.  0 = MIDI Clock is off; 1 = MIDI Clock on, and Song
# Position and MIDI Continue will be sent, if needed; 2 = MIDI
# Clock Modulo, where MIDI clocking will not begin until the song
# position reaches the start modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks].
# A value of -1 indicates that the output port is totally
# disabled.  One can set this value manually for devices that are
# present, but not available, perhaps because another application
# has exclusive access to the device (e.g. on Windows).

[midi-meta-events]

# This section defines some features of MIDI meta-event handling.
# Normally, tempo events are supposed to occur in the first track
# (pattern 0).  But one can move this track elsewhere to accomodate
# one's existing body of tunes.  If affects where tempo events are
# recorded.  The default value is 0, the maximum is 1023.
# A pattern must exist at this number for it to work.

[midi-input]

2   # number of input MIDI busses

0 1  # buss number, input status
# Input buss name: [1] 14:0 Midi Through Port-0
1 0  # buss number, input status

# If set to 1, this option allows the master MIDI bus to record
# (filter) incoming MIDI data by channel, allocating each incoming
# MIDI event to the sequence that is set to that channel.
# This is an option adopted from the Seq32 project at GitHub.

[manual-alsa-ports]

# Set to 1 to have sequencer64 create its own ALSA ports and not
