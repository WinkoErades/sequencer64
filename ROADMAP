Sequencer64 Roadmap
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-09-10 to 2019-10-20

Latest version: 0.96.7

The starting point for the Sequencer64 project is version 0.9.2 of Seq24 from
Debian.  The initial work for this Seq24 reboot started in late July of 2015,
when I was laid up for awhile, and had basically finished documenting the
Yoshimi software synthesizer.

This roadmap is a bit old.  Lots of good suggestions have come in from users,
and we have tended to give them what they want.  :-)  See the TODO instead.
Also see the contrib/notes/bugs-to-investigate.txt file, which is also a bit
out-of-date.

Also note that there is a major refactoring of Sequencer64, called Seq66. It is
experimental but it works.
